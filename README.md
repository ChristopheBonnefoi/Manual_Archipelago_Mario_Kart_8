# Archipelago Manual for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe

## Welcome!
Welcome to my Archipelago manual for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Switch. This Archipelago setup is inspired by those from rampantepsilon and jokerfactor. I aim to create a comprehensive Archipelago with fun and challenging checks.

## Project Status
The project is currently in beta as I plan to add many more features, as outlined in the **Future Features** section.

## Current Features
- **All Rainbow Roads Complete**: Complete all Rainbow Roads in the game, including DLC tracks.

## Goal Explanations

### All Rainbow Roads Complete:
This goal requires completing all Rainbow Road tracks in the game, including those from DLCs.

### Additional Explanations:
For trophy-related checks (bronze, silver, and gold), obtaining the gold trophy will automatically validate the silver and bronze trophies.

## Future Features (not guaranteed)
- Add different colors for characters, such as Yoshi and Shy Guy.
- Introduce checks for the Time Trial mode, requiring players to beat a ghost on each track.
- Add checks and items for the Race mode in the game.
- Introduce new goals.
- Implement tokens.
- Add checks for every 10 coins collected in each race.
- Introduce a "Funny" category for checks.
- Include difficulty settings in the item pool.
