# Archipelago Manual for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe

## Welcome!
Welcome to my Archipelago manual for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Switch. This Archipelago setup is inspired by those created by RampantEpsilon and JokerFactor. My goal is to create a comprehensive Archipelago with fun and challenging checks.

## Project Status
The project is currently in beta, and I plan to add many more features, as outlined in the **Future Features** section.

## Current Features
- **All Rainbow Roads Complete**: Complete all Rainbow Road tracks in the game, including DLC tracks.

## General Information for the Game

### Goal Explanations

#### All Rainbow Roads Complete:
This goal requires completing all Rainbow Road tracks in the game, including those from DLCs. If you don't have the DLCs, no problemâ€”simply validate the goal once you have completed the Rainbow Roads from the original game.

### Additional Explanations:
For trophy-related checks (bronze, silver, and gold), obtaining the gold trophy will automatically validate the silver and bronze trophies.

For cups, unlocking the tracks is validated for both Grand Prix and VS Race modes to avoid having to unlock the same tracks twice.

## Future Features (not guaranteed)
- Introduce checks for Time Trial mode, requiring players to beat a ghost on each track.
- Add checks and items for Race mode in the game.
- Introduce new goals.
- Add checks for every 10 coins collected in each race.
- Introduce a "Funny" category for checks.
- Include difficulty settings in the item pool.
